      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Chris, the Cloud Cowboy. By day I&amp;rsquo;m a Cloud infrastructure architect, with a focus on security, governance and automation. By night&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m well I guess I&amp;rsquo;m still that, just more tired.
I work mostly in the Azure cloud. I do some work in AWS, and have certifications in both clouds, but I greatly prefer Azure. My team and I focus on developing guardrails and security controls for our developer community to prevent them from making any big mistakes, and to automatically fix problems where we can.</description>
